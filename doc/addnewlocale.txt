Adding a new locale to the Numbertext distribution

1. Make a new Soros program in the data/ subdirectory under the
name of your locale (the format and the numbertext algorithm
are described in format.txt).

2. Translate the function description for your localized LibreOffice
in the data/titles.txt

3. Type make in the root directory or without a Unix or Cygwin
environment, you can manually extend the
pythonpath/numbertext_locales.py and compile your Soros program with the
following command in the pythonpath subfolder:

python Compile.py data/your_locale.sor >numbertext_your_locale.py
python CompileTitles.py data/titles.txt >numbertext_titles.py

4. Type make dist to zip the distribution or use your zip compresser
in the root directory, eg. 

zip -r numbertext.oxt .
