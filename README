= Usage =

After restarting OpenOffice.org, there are two new Calc functions,
NUMBERTEXT() and MONEYTEXT().

Examples:

=NUMBERTEXT(25)
=NUMBERTEXT(25;"th-TH")
=MONEYTEXT(25)
=MONEYTEXT(25;"USD")
=MONEYTEXT(25;"CNY";"zh-suzhou")

Note: the arguments will be extended by the decimal place
argument in the next version, according to the
NUMBERTEXT/MONEYTEXT specification
(See in OpenOffice.org Issue 103746):

=NUMBERTEXT(25)
=NUMBERTEXT(25.1234;2;"th-TH")
=MONEYTEXT(25)
=MONEYTEXT(25;"USD")
=MONEYTEXT(25;"CNY";2;"zh-suzhou")

= Development =

See doc/addnewlocale.txt and doc/sorosspec.odt

== Integrated development environment ==

There is a JavaScript/HTML IDE in this distribution:

Open web/webroot/Soros.html in a JavaScript capable browser,

or use the on-line version of the IDE (http://numbertext.org).

= Test =

make check

test/thaicheck.ods is a simple test of the equivalence of
the Soros implementation of Thai number to number name conversion
and BAHTTEXT function.
