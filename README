= Installation in OpenOffice.org =

Tools->Extension Manager->Add

= Usage =

After restarting OpenOffice.org, there are two new Calc functions,
NUMBERTEXT() and MONEYTEXT().

Examples:

=NUMBERTEXT(25)
=NUMBERTEXT(25;"th-TH")
=MONEYTEXT(25)
=MONEYTEXT(25;"USD")
=MONEYTEXT(25;"CNY";"zh-ZH")

= Development =

See doc/addnewlocale.txt and doc/sorosspec.odt

For general Calc and (portable Excel) Add-In developments, see

Jan Holst Jensen's excellent Add-in example and documentation:

http://biochemfusion.com/doc/Calc_addin_howto.html

== Integrated development environment ==

There is a JavaScript/HTML IDE in this distribution:

Open web/webroot/Soros.html in a JavaScript capable browser,

or use the on-line version of the IDE (http://numbertext.org).

= Test =

make check

test/thaicheck.ods is a simple test of the equivalence of
the Soros implementation of Thai number to number name conversion
and BAHTTEXT function.
