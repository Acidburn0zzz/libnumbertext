= Build C++11 =

autoreconf -i
./configure
make

# test it

src/numbertext -l en 123

= Build Java jar =

cd java
make

= Build and using LibreOffice Extension =

make -f Makefile lo

and install the *.oxt package by
Tools->Extension Manager->Add of LibreOffice.

After restarting OpenOffice.org/LibreOffice, there are
two new Calc functions,
NUMBERTEXT() and MONEYTEXT().

Examples:

=NUMBERTEXT(25)
=NUMBERTEXT(25;"th-TH")
=MONEYTEXT(25)
=MONEYTEXT(25;"USD")
=MONEYTEXT(25;"CNY";"zh-ZH")

= Development =

See doc/addnewlocale.txt and doc/sorosspec.odt

For general Calc and (portable Excel) Add-In developments, see
Jan Holst Jensen's excellent Add-in example and documentation:

http://biochemfusion.com/doc/Calc_addin_howto.html

== Integrated development environment ==

There is a JavaScript/HTML IDE in this distribution. 

Use the online version: http://numbertext.org/Soros.html or
build it with

make -f Makefile.orig

and open web/webroot/Soros.html in a JavaScript capable browser,

= Test =

make -f Makefile.orig check

test/thaicheck.ods is a simple test of the equivalence of
the Soros implementation of Thai number to number name conversion
and BAHTTEXT function.
